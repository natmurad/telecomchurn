# :running::standing_person::standing_person: Telecom Customer Churn

The objective of this project is predict behavior to retain customers. Analysing all relevant customer data can help to develop focused customer retention programs. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets).
It contains information about the State, Area, Account, Type of plan of the customers, how much they spend on charges, the schedule they do more calls and others. Here these variables are explored in order to get insights about customer behavior, and Machine Learning Algorithms are used to predict if a customer will continue with its plan or not.
